                <p>
                    The school gym is often too crowded. Students are frustrated because many of the machines and equipment are often already being used, and there is no way to tell how busy the gym is before they leave. Our solution is to provide the user with a way to tell how busy the school gym is.

                    Our group worked together to come up with features, problems, potential solutions, and design ideas that could help address the problem with the school gym.
