                <h2>Problem Statement: School Gym</h2>
                <p>
                    The school gym is often too crowded. Students are frustrated because many of the machines and equipment are often already being used, and there is no way to tell how busy the gym is before they leave. Our solution is to provide the user with a way to tell how busy the school gym is.

                    Our group worked together to come up with features, problems, potential solutions, and design ideas that could help address the problem with the school gym.

                    My storyboard displays how an app developer would potentially respond to problems with the app, and how he would fix them. In the storyboard he is making the app interface more user-friendly.

                <p>
                    Each team member drew at least 3 sketches for our mobile app. Each of the sketches are a possible implementation of the School Gym app. We then decided which sketch would be the best possible design for our app.
